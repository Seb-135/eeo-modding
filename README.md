## Modifications
4 new blocks have been added:

They are kind of like switches and coins mashed together. The square, switch-shaped counter can be picked up infinitely by the player, which would be most useful inside systems. The circular one can only be collected once, just like coins. Both of these can go to plus or minus 99 points per block, and there's no limit on how many points the player can have in total (they can't have less than 0, though).
The doors/gates act like coindoors, ranging from 1 to 999 to toggle them.

The [level](https://github.com/Seb-135/eeo-modding/releases/download/v1.0-counters/Point_Counters_-_seb135.counterlvl) included with the release contains potentially helpful uses of these new blocks.
